/**
 * Data Processing Pipelines
 * 
 * This module exports data processing pipeline integrations that can be:
 * - Triggered via API endpoints
 * - Invoked by cron jobs
 * - Called from n8n workflows
 * - Executed in background jobs
 * 
 * Pipelines are defined in the /pipelines directory at the monorepo root.
 * This module acts as a bridge between the API layer and pipeline logic.
 * 
 * Example pipelines:
 * - Skiptracing pipeline
 * - Property scoring pipeline
 * - SMS campaign pipeline
 * - Data ingestion pipeline
